## Coding lifelines: fostering contextual connections while coding

Students are learning all the time and through different ways. In Code in Place there are many students who might encounter the same type of problems. What if there was a way to match the type of problem they are working on with peers on similar problems (or with ones who already finished it)? I'm imagining some kind of connection with the code editor browser where it can recommend connecting live to someone who is struggling on the same thing - or present an optional opportunity for someone who has already completed that section (through a similar process) to provide ""help"". The ""help"" that's provided should be scaffolded to support student learning and not just be sharing the code itself - although since everything is recorded we would be able to also research the types of help moves that are actually provided.

This prototype could also explore patterns around help-seeking behaviour: how long/hard should one work at something individually before looking for a thought partner? Maybe there can be like an attempt tracker or way to identify frustration and time spent on the problem without making progress before this appears as an option."
